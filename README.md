# README-Gen
### ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

### This last week i was tasked with creating a README generator. This entire script was created with node.js. It is designed to ask you a few questions i.e name of project, which license and to describe the project/installation. Once you have filled out the fields prompted to you it will generate the markdown page.
